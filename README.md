# HDR IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT

This project is for HDR Image Quality Assessment(IQA) based on the paper "Blind High Dynamic Range Image Quality Assessment Using Deep Learning"[1]. That paper proposes the use of convolutional neural network combined with a saliency map for HDR IQA. This project requires the deep learning libraries, [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).

Paper and models will be released in September 2017.
